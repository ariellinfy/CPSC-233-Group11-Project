# Gomoku Game

## About
This game revolves around a turn-based two player format, where each player takes turns in placing a single black/white stone on an empty intersection within a grid board. After these stones are placed, they can no longer be moved. The main objective is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of exactly five stones before your opponent. A row with six or more counts as a draw. 

The current application will prompt the user several setting options before starting the game:
- To play against a human player or computer - medium level computer by default
- Difficulty level of the computer player (if computer is chosen in #1) - medium by default
- To play as black or white stone (black always goes first) - user goes first by default
- Set the board size (9/13/15/19) - 15x15 by default
